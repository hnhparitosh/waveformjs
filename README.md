Waveform.JS
==========

Waveform.JS is no longer operational.

This service and SDK used to provide an SDK to translate a waveform into
floating points to render on an HTML5 canvas.

An unsupported alternative to render waveforms as JSON, is to replace the
`.png` extension with `.json` on the [Track
waveform_url](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/reference#tracks).

i am recreating the results
